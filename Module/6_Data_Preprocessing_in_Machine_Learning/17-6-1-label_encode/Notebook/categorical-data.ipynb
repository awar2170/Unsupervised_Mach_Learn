    "\n",
    "While many datasets contain categorical features (e.g., M or F), machine learning algorithms typically only work with numerical data. Categorical and text data must therefore be converted to numerical data for use in machine learning—which is what we'll do in this section.\n",

Encoding text labels into numerical values is one preprocessing step. Later we'll discuss scaling, another preprocessing step.\n",

If a loan applicant has a bachelor's degree, that column will read 1, and the others (High School or Below, Master or Above, and college) will read 0. For an applicant who did not graduate from high school, the education_Bachelor, education_Master or Above, and education_college columns will be 0, and the education_High School or Below will show 1."
